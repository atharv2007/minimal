# Machine Learning Intern

1. Wrote web crawling scripts using APIs (Scrapy, Tweepy, and PyGoogleNews) to gather news articles from reputed sources in the world of finance for the project "FABRIC: AI-based Finance Research Assistant" (accuracy - 93.2%)
2. Conducted research and implement of GPT-neo (a transformer-based model) and BERT-like model for the tasks of Named Entity Recognition(NER), Text Summarization, and Sentiment Analysis.
3. Analyzed the datasets provided by NTT Data, a Japan-based company. Compiled, annotated, and categorized around 1200 texts under Social, Governmental, and Environmental categories as part of the Data Annotation project

# Software Development Intern

1. Conducted research for brain-computer interaction and was part of a team of 4 interns to create an EEG recording cap and design an electronic amplifier circuit to record and observe brainwave activity
2. Led and managed two project teams: the Home Automation System team and the Hospital Bed Management team
3. Constructed backend database in MySQL and APIs in Flask to support a Flutter-based mobile application along with basic server-side scripting for Raspberry Pi, for both the above-mentioned projects

# Innovators Hub, Humidity Forecasting
1. Developed a model to forecast relative and absolute humidity using XGBoost (Accuracy for absolute humidity forecasting: 96.439) and FCNN (Accuracy for absolute humidity forecasting: 96.655)
2. Deployed both models in a combination to devise an Ensemble Method, yielding higher accuracy of 96.77% for Relative Humidity and 97.66% for Absolute Humidity
3. Presented a paper, titled 'Using Ensemble Method to Forecast Relative and Absolute Humidity' at the International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Digital Technologies (ICCIDT â€“ 2021) and was published in the International Journal of Engineering, Research, and Technology (IJERT) (ISSN: 2278-0181)
